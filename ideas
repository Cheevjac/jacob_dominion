On the topic web play I am looking into some main options.
1) Is a webpage based method that has a python fast api backend and a java script front end.
    --- A pro of this design is that it allows for future expansion into a gui if I wanted.
    --- A downside of this design is it is likely a bit more complicated and less performant than other options.
    --- I think I have some experience with the javascript, but it would be a lot of new information.

2) Telnet based connection, and using putty or something else to connect.
    --- This would be really straightforward I think. I would really only need the client and server as a message passing interface.
    --- One upside of this design is that it would be very similar to the current implementation
    --- One downside of this design is that it doesn't offer as much flexibilty in interface, and it might be harder for others to use.

3) I think a websocket implementation could be pretty good.
    --- It looks like the python websocket implementation relies on asycnio, which would be good to learn
    --- This would be fast, and pretty easy to implement
    --- I think this doesn't really help with the future gui, but it's not too bad.

I think no matter what interface I use I need to figure out a better message passing method where messages can get sent to one user or to all the users at once. I think I can start doing this without having to do the online stuff, but I am not sure exactly how I want to do it. I also wonder if doing the game log would overlap with this.

When looking at fastapi there is this thing called typer which is basically an api like formatting for CLI apps. It looked interesting, but I kinda prefer my implementation. Fastapi looks like a good tool for this purpose and a good tool to learn.

Telnetlib doesn't look too bad, It think the implementation would be really quick. It is probably less supported than fastapi, but the library still looks good.

I think I am going to go with websockets.

On the topic of a game log, I am debating a few different things. If I want to do anayltics or machine learning on the game logs I want to put in detailed information in a dense machine readable format. I think just logging the messages sent to the user is one option, but it seems worse to me.
